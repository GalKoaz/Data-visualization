<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Introduction to Data Science Final Project 2020

In this project we will use all the tools we learned during the course on machine learning, in the first stage we will deal with the ability to solve probability exercises, in the second stage we will focus on our internalization and realization of tools learned for pandas, numpy and visualization, in the last part we will focus on machine learning.
Which includes classification and regression, ie the ability to take a data set and analyze it to predict exact values and use appropriate models for this.

"The world is just a one Big Data problem üòÑ"

---------

### Improving NoteBook

Within this part we were asked to solve probable questions.
Some of which were solved with the help of Bayes' theorem, random variables,  inference and understanding from graphs.

### Fashion Mnist

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images‚Äîconsisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

The original MNIST dataset contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. "If it doesn't work on MNIST, it won't work at all", they said. "Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others."

### Cats vs Dogs

Web services are often protected with a challenge that's supposed to be easy for people to solve, but difficult for computers. Such a challenge is often called a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) or HIP (Human Interactive Proof). HIPs are used for many purposes, such as to reduce email and blog spam and prevent brute-force attacks on web site passwords.

Asirra (Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access) is a HIP that works by asking users to identify photographs of cats and dogs. This task is difficult for computers, but studies have shown that people can accomplish it quickly and accurately. Many even think it's fun! Here is an example of the Asirra interface:

Asirra is unique because of its partnership with Petfinder.com, the world's largest site devoted to finding homes for homeless pets. They've provided Microsoft Research with over three million images of cats and dogs, manually classified by people at thousands of animal shelters across the United States. Kaggle is fortunate to offer a subset of this data for fun and research.

<!-- Classification -->

### Hands Movement

Who does not like mushrooms üçÑüçÑüçÑ in his pizza or pasta ?!? 

I chose to work on a dataset to predict whether a mushrooms is edible or poisonous!

mushrooms.csv dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one.

* Time period: Donated to UCI ML 27 April 1987

I'm pretty sure its make u a little curious, So what are you waiting for ?? 

get in quickly to explore my work! üòÄ
